## **Snake Game**

### **Project Description**

This Python project implements a Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. Players control a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with walls or their own tail.

### **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.12 installed
   * `turtle` library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

2. **Installation:**
   * Clone this repository or download the Python files (`main.py`, `snake.py`, `food.py`, `scoreboard.py`).

3. **Usage:**
   * Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   * Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`

### **Gameplay**

* Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the snake's direction.
* Eat the red food objects to grow longer.
* Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail.
* Your score will be displayed at the top of the screen.

### **Project Structure**

* **`main.py`:** Sets up the game window, initializes the snake, food, and scoreboard objects, and handles the game loop.
* **`snake.py`:** Defines the `Snake` class, which manages the snake's segments, movement, and growth.
* **`food.py`:** Defines the `Food` class, responsible for creating and placing food objects on the screen.
* **`scoreboard.py`:** Defines the `Scoreboard` class that keeps track of the score and displays it on the screen.

### **Dependencies**

This project relies on the `turtle` library, which is part of the standard Python library.
